            <p class="transition">International students that have been admitted and choose to attend TAG must submit proof of financial support and a passport copy in order to be issued an I-20 or DS-2019. This documentation is <strong>required</strong>&nbsp;by the U.S. Department
                of Homeland Security in order to receive your immigration documents from TAG and ultimately your student visa. <strong>It is not necessary to submit proof of financial support or passport copies to <em>be considered</em> <em>for admission</em> to TAG.</strong>                Documents can be submitted after an admission decision has been reached.</p>
            <p class="transition">Since TAG provides funding to the majority of admitted PhD students, PhD applicants need only submit a passport copy. No financial statement is required unless the university has confirmed that no funding will be provided to the admitted student.</p>
            <h3 class="transition">Program Costs</h3>
            <p class="transition">TAG requires that proof of financial support cover the estimated program costs and living expenses for <em>one year</em>, as determined by the TAG Financial Aid Office. To determine your program costs, please find the program to which you
                are applying from the table below.</p>
            <p class="transition"><strong>These costs are for immigration purposes only</strong>; they should not be considered a bill of expense for your program. Your actual expenses may vary based on course load, living situation, lifestyle, etc. Regardless of your actual
                expenses, the I-20/DS-2019 costs below cannot be negotiated. For example, you may not subtract living costs if you intend to live with a relative in Los Angeles. For questions on your degree program’s curriculum, units, classes, special
                fees, etc. please contact the admissions office of your program.</p>
            <p class="transition"><em>Please note: If you have dependents who will apply for F-2/J-2 visas, you must be able to provide an additional $13,403 for your spouse and $6,701 for each child.&nbsp;</em></p>
