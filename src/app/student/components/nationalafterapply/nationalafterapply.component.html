        <p class="extra-margin-top transition"><strong><em>You will receive your 10-digit USC ID via email within two to three business days after you submit your online application. Please keep this ID on record and make sure to include it in all your communication with USC. You will also need to include it when mailing any documents to the university. It is important to note that your 10-digit USC ID is different from the USC CAS ID you will receive when you begin your application. That ID is only required for&nbsp;technical support during the application process and is not issued by the university.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
        <h2 class="transition">Step 5: Submit your Official Transcripts</h2>
        <p class="transition">Make sure to upload a copy of your university-issued&nbsp;transcripts (i.e.issued on official letterhead) with your online application. <em>Please note, unofficial transcripts from university student portals are not acceptable.</em>&nbsp;Additionally,
            you must also send us&nbsp;a copy of your official transcripts. Please click <a href="/lightboxes/international-students-transcript-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for detailed guidelines for sending your official transcripts
            to USC.</p>
        <h2 class="transition">Step 6: Submit your Official Test Scores</h2>
        <p class="transition">Most USC graduate programs require either GRE or GMAT scores. Please review the test score requirements for your intended program on their website. Please make sure to include your test scores as part of your application.&nbsp;Once you submit
            your application, you will also be able to return to it in order to add additional test scores if you take these tests afterwards.</p>
        <p class="transition"><strong>However, only scores received electronically from the testing service are considered official. USC does not accept self-reported test scores or paper scores sent via postal mail. </strong></p>
        <p class="transition">USC’s ETS school code is <strong>4852</strong>. Applicants sending any tests administered by ETS, such as the GRE, should use this code to ensure that USC receives your official test results. <strong>No department code is required</strong>.</p>
        <p class="transition">If you are sending GMAT scores, please select “University of Southern California” from the list of schools available for official score submission. <strong>Please check with your intended program to determine the program code for the GMAT</strong>.</p>
        <h2 class="transition">Step 7: Track&nbsp;your Application Status</h2>
        <p class="transition">Our admission processing center receives a high volume of materials during the peak admission period (November through May). During these months, please allow approximately 15 business days from the date of receipt of your official academic records
            to process these documents and match them to&nbsp;your application in our database.</p>
        <p class="transition">Graduate applicants are responsible for properly submitting all items required for review and responding promptly to requests for additional materials or information. Once you submit your application, all notifications regarding missing transcripts
            and other materials required to complete our evaluation will be emailed to you. Therefore, it is important that you regularly check the email address you provided on the application. <b>Please note: You will not receive confirmation emails when specific materials have been received, but only when we are requesting additional materials.&nbsp;</b></p>
        <h2 class="transition">Step 8:&nbsp;View Your Decision</h2>
        <p class="transition">While the Office of Graduate Admission processes all graduate applications, admission decisions are ultimately made by the program to which you have applied. Once the admission committee for your intended program of study has completed the review
            process, you will receive an email notification from the Office of Graduate Admission informing you that a decision has been made.</p>
        <p class="transition">The length of time required to make a decision varies by the program, type of degree, as well as the size of the applicant pool. Most applicants to the fall term receive decision notifications by June. Most applicants to the spring term receive
            decision notifications by December.</p>
        <p class="transition">When you receive your decision notification, follow the instructions on the email to register for and view your decision at <a href="https://you.usc.edu/login/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youSC</a>.</p>
