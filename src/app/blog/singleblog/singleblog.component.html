                                    <h2>University of New Haven STEM based MPH (Masters in Public Health)</h2>
                                    <p>University Of New Haven is full of vibrant colors. Fall has arrived, so every time you walk down the road enroute the campus, you’re traversing through bright colorful fall foliage. The campus is filled with a variety of students sitting and studying under cool breeze and the warmth of the sun, faculty taking their kids out for an outing and others playing and strolling with their dogs. This is the peak of fall, when everyone is in their calm ‘Zen’ and we have a while before exam crunch time starts.</p>

                                    <p>After studying in India and coming in as an international student, I expected the curriculum to be more hectic than high school- something I was anticipating with anxiety.</p>

                                    <h3>Rewarding</h3>
                                    <p>Initially after landing at a new place, there was significant change in the culture which was definitely challenging but before I knew it, it was the novelty of the environment that I felt most rewarding.</p>
                                    <h3>What I Experienced</h3>
                                    <p>I experienced cultures and events; I never even knew existed.  I came here thinking that I would study Public Health however taking classes in fields like Epidemiology, ethics, and global health- made me expand my horizon. Despite being someone who is conservative side, I went out of my way to try new things, ranging from Zumba to Mediterranean food. This then inculcated many interests that I love.</p>

                                    <p>Over the two years, many experiences helped me find a good circle of friends whose affections and interests aligned with mine. Everyone I met, wanted to learn more about the other’s life. This just showed me that everyone here loved me for who I am. They want to know more about my culture, my hometown and the way I’ve lived my life. I remember interacting with all my hall mates about the different traditions and aspects of India. They all enjoyed the annual celebration of Holi and also eagerly came to the big Indian party that was hosted at the end of the year. I have also imbibed a lot of information about other cultures, religions and places whilst being at the university. All this has made me look at the friends I have made, from all over the world, as a giant family. The bonds that I have made with this diverse group of people are stronger than I ever expected. We respect differences and this makes us unique. You are expected to be exactly who you are and in being so find a home away from home. This in fact is one of the main reasons I feel proud to be at a place like University of New Haven. It has taught me to that I am far more capable, valued and loved than I could ever know. I have started to experience my personality in a different light and it has helped me grow into a different person and helped me face new challenges.</p>
